# DGM3760

This is my Final projet for DGM 3760: Book Tracker

The user stories that were provided with the final proposal, for the most part, should be accurate. I was not, however, able to complete the "Search for Reviews on Books" or the "Click purchase to link to purchase the book". Thise options were not given in the API and I was not prepared to come up with a way to implement those items. 

A final note, the Add List option does work and create another list, however changing to a seperate list of books did not end up happening as I realized slightly too late that I would need to create an array of lists holding an array of objects for the App.
